## Motivation:

### Computational costs:
With decreasing computational costs and powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) available, it has become possible to analyze three-dimensional (3D) medical images, such as CT, DTI, fMRI, Ultrasound and MRI scans using 3D deep learning. 

## 3D convolutional layers
it is quite similar to 2D convolutional layers
3D convolutional
$$x_{i, j, k}^{\ell}=\sum_a \sum_b \sum_c \omega_{a, b, c} y_{(i+a)(j+b)(k+c)}^{\ell-1}+b^{\ell}$$
activation function
$$y_{i, j, k}^{\ell}=f\left(x_{i, j, k}^{\ell}\right)$$

## 3D Medical Imaging Pre-Processing

(1) artifact removal, (2) normalization, (3) slice timing correction (STC), (4) image registration and (5) bias field correction.

While all the steps, (1) to (5), help in getting reliable results, STC and image registration are very important in the case of 3D medical images (especially MR and CT images). Artifact removal and normalization are the most performed preprocessing steps across the modalities.

Disadvantages:
It **seems** need a fixed 3D shape. But our dataset have different shape in thrid dimension.
